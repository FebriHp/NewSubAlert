# Subdomain Monitoring and Vulnerability Alert Bot

This script monitors a list of domains for newly discovered subdomains via `crt.sh`. For each new subdomain found, it checks its availability, resolves the IP, detects known CVEs using Shodan and Vulners APIs, and attempts to access sensitive files. All findings are reported via Telegram bot.
